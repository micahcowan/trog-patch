ROM patches included:
  famicom2p: A patch that lets the 2nd player use the A button for
             joining (permitting use via Everdrive on a Famicom)

  fair-pvp:  A patch that equalizes/balances PvP fighting in multiplayer
             games (without this patch, player 1 has a _very_ heavy
             advantage)

  nerfed:    A patch that removes... basically everything from the game.
             Not useful for playing the game, useful for testing PvP :)

  mirror2p:  A patch that mirrors player 1 controller to player 2
             movement, reversing left/right. There is a bug which can
             cause player 2 not to stop punching player 1 once punching
             is started; this behavior does not appear if combined with
             the fair-pvp patch. This patch was designed to facilitate
             testing, and not to enhance gameplay.


During the course of developing these patches, the following Game Genie
cheat codes were also discovered:

    ZEUAIAPA - Infinite t-rex (1 of 2)
    SUXPZKVS - Infinite t-rex (2 of 2)
    ATVPTTXZ - Removes all enemies (trogs) from the game. Kinda eerie!
    EYSAUTEI - Players only fall if they are invincible
    AEKEZAGP - Players don't spawn with invincibility
    AAXOAXPZ - Prevents players from picking up powerup items
    GAOOGXTE - Prevents players from picking up eggs
    PXOKUSPE - Prevents powerups and tarpits - and exits! - from spawning
    EOOTSAAP - Enables player 2 to join/continue with the A button
               (game genie equivalent to famicom2p patch)
