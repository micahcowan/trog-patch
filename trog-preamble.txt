This program listing was automatically generated
using Bisqwit's "clever-disasm" tool from
https://bisqwit.iki.fi/source/nescom.html

Inputs used were a trog.ini file available at
https://github.com/micahcowan/trog-patch
and the Trog! NES rom file (not provided)

While this file presents a (partially) annotated disassembly of the
Trog! NES program code, it is intended for reading/reference purposes
only - it cannot be used as input to any particular assembler
(including, at least at this time, nescom, the assembler that
clever-disasm ships with). However, it provides sufficient information
to understand the inner workings and mechanics of the game,
and to modify and extend it (and indeed, I have used it successfully to
that end).

Useful labels at which to start reading are: Reset (where code starts
executing from), GamePlayLoop, HandleThePlayers_, PlayerStateNormalPlay_1

Enjoy!
